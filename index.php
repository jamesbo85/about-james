		<p>I was born on June 28, 1985. I was born and raised in Dallas, TX. After a unsuccessful semester and a half of
			community college I took a job at small municiple airport in Dallas. I then moved on to a series of jobs
			including selling CutCo knives, running a stainless steel warehouse. For the past 3 years I've been managing a
			ice hockey rink as well as coaching a team and teaching classes and private lesson for kids ages 4 to 18.</p>
		<p>Along with playing hockey, I really enjoy rock climbing, reading and cooking. I recently quite my job to attend this
			course. I took this risk because I reached a ceiling at the hockey rink and coaching is seasonal and sporatic.
			I have always had an interest in coding and I see this course as a path to a rewarding career in a high demand
			field. Which path my career will take is unkown. to be honest i dont know enough about coding yet to know what
			I want to specialize in. Be it front end or back end or some combo of both.</p>
